# Working-Portfolio
Made by Samantha Karpovck 
Changes will be made throughout this course as new projects are completed. 

## Built with: 

HTML and CSS 

## Header
The header showcases my name and a navigation bar that includes links to other sections of the site. The header is "sticky" and navigation links are complete with active responses when hovering over them. I have not linked a resume just yet. 

## About me
In the about me section, I've included a short bio and a photo. 

## My work
This section includes the current run-buddy site with an active link as well as placeholders for future projects. 

## Contact Me
This section includes 2 ways to reach me and a link to my github as well as Linkedin.
